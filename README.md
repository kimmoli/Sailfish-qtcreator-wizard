Wizard for Sailfish app with some C++/QML interaction. 

Might not pass harbour check, I haven't tested.

please file a bug or contribute if you find something to improve.

Note: Put this into a new folder under \SailfishOS\share\qtcreator\templates\wizards (at least it is this under windows) and restart QtCreator
